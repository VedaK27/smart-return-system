# 🚚 Smart Return System — Predict & Route Product Returns with ML + Logic

A full-stack system that predicts product return probability using machine learning and intelligently routes returned items (restock, refurbish, inspect) using business logic. Built for e-commerce platforms to optimize reverse logistics and reduce operational losses.

---

## 📦 Problem Statement

E-commerce companies suffer heavy losses from returned products due to:
- High return rates during sale seasons
- Inefficient handling of returns (restock vs refurbish vs recycle)
- Manual decisions costing time and money

🧠 This project solves it by predicting returns before they happen and suggesting smart routing decisions for returned products.
